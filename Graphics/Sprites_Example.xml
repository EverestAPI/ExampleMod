        Any sprites added to this file (Graphics/Sprites.xml) will be automatically merged with the vanilla Game SpriteBank.
        Sprite definitions that conflict will override existing ones, which is NOT RECCOMMENDED.

        SpriteBanks that are defined in other files will not be automatically merged, but must be loaded and used separately from the GFX.Game SpriteBank.
