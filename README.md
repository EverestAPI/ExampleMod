__The purpose of this mod is to provide a comprehensive example of an Everest code mod.__

The goal is to show and document every feature that is available for code modders, provided that it is not already covered in general-purpose language and framework tutorials.

This mod is not designed to be used except for learning purposes.  
It should not affect any in-game behaviour by default, apart from what is required to demonstrate a concept.
